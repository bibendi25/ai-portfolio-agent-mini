## The brief
I was seconded to Barclaycard in Northampton from Barclays to work on a Strategic Identity and Verification (ID&V) programme that was looking at how best to take the innovations in card technologies and security by applying them to cross-platform applications Barclaycard users.


## My role
I designed responsive interfaces for desktops and the MyBarclaycard Apps for Smart Phones. The full complement of UX practices were applied including detailed requirements gathering, analysis of data, reviewing the current processes and recommending enhancements via user journeys and prototyping potential new device agnostic solutions. I also worked from a strategic perspective, designing possible future fin-tech advances, as part of a comprehensive Design Ideation that worked to try to resolve Barclaycard’s fraud losses that were disproportionate to their market share, especially in unrecoverable Card Not Present transactions (3D secure) and Account Takeover fraud. 


## Major Accomplishments
- Seconded to Barclaycard’s Identity and Verification (ID&V) programme to review proposed new physical bankcard.
- Analysed user data and provided best practice feedback to senior level stakeholders
- Identified inconsistencies with the programme’s proposition and saved Barclaycard £150m by cancelling the ill-conceived programme that Barclays had requested I carry out a strategic review on their behalf.
- Worked with testing and onboarding teams to develop new digital, device agnostic solutions
