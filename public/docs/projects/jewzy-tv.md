## The brief
A client with a new concept in Video on Demand and Streaming to a specific audience in the US asked me to help develop a Vimeo-based TV and video streaming service with a distinct ‘Jew-ish” flavour. He had already had initial ‘not quite original’ brand work done by another agency and JEWZY was born.


## My role
As a User Experience Consultant, my role, one of design and operational oversight, was to customise the default Vimeo service to provide a “Netflix” style front-end and enhance the assets provided by some of the more fringe TV and movie production companies and to encourage investors through captivating and intuitive design.


## Major Accomplishments
- Created a common UX and IA interface using VIMEO defaults and video assets available
- Generated a concise but flexible set of genres and categories
- Utilising the full Adobe Suite, I cut new trailers, designed new promo material
- Create all the assets for a brand new digital only Film Festival - American Jewish Film Festival
- Taking the default and random nature of the delivered Video and Graphical assets, I customised a new Vimeo interface whilst maintaining and enhancing the existing brand to ensure a more coherent UX interface.
- Created promotional video assets from the films using Adobe Premiere Pro.
- Created a partially functioning Prototype of the streaming service used to promote the service with investors.
- Use assets available to design enticing promotions for films and Service
