## The brief
The brief was to investigate and propose areas for improvement within the current information architecture of Mercedes-Benz.co.uk. My client wanted to enhance the way in which customers interacted with the website when selecting the vehicles and services they, as prospective and authenticated users, required.

## My role
As UX Consultant for I completed a full UX review, including assessing the structure of the site, creating personas and applying them to identified scenarios. I also designed user journeys to help answer hypotheses such as “if I enable a user to customise a new vehicle, they are more likely to purchase the vehicle”. It was important to prove and/or disprove these hypotheses by performing user testing and research.

The challenges included: 
- The existing website’s navigation was not intuitive, and users found it difficult to find what they were looking for.
- Best practices in Information Architecture or User Experience had never been applied
- Little was known about the visitors to the site; the analytics did not reflect what business thought they knew.
- Authenticated users had few visual or logical prompts to identify what services were available

## Major Accomplishments
- Reviewed and redesigned the entire navigational structure of the sit
- Created comprehensive sitemaps to enhance organic SEO, Accessibility and Usability.
- Identified realistic personas and scenario-based user journeys
- Developed and defined a number of assumptions for each journey to help prove or disprove the hypotheses for the business
- Tested the findings using online surveys
- Delivered a comprehensive Digital Information Architecture Document
