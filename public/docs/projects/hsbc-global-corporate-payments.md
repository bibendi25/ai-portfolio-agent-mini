## The brief
As a UX team, we were tasked with transforming HSBC Global Corporate Users’ experience with making global payments. The legacy system had been used for over a decade and was straining with the demand and constant upgrades and updates to browsers, operating systems and Users’ growing expectations of having a simpler and more intuitive interface for payments. 

We had to create a strategic proof of concept for a modern payments experience that provided a simplified, intuitive modern interface to allow HSBCnet customers to make payments. The interface should be clean and quick for day to day users, but should remain intuitive for occasional users.


## My role
As Global UX Manager for Corporate Payments Programme, I was responsible for the UX, UI team in the UK and India and worked with senior stakeholders on all strategic planning for UX within the programme.

As part of a wider global Digital Transformation programme, I worked within the Global Payments programme migrating legacy Corporate Banking payment systems onto new platforms integrating improved front end UX designs, whilst continuing BAU enhancements and ensuring all HSBC Global Corporate payments met the ever-changing global regulations.
