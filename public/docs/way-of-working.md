“I’ve worked on effective waterfall projects but since the uptake of Lean and Agile practices in User Experience, coupled with strong design-led, data-driven activities and practices, I now see how incredible ideas can come to life, slowly and more efficiently and users can benefit sooner.”

EARLY PROJECT INVOLVEMENT
1.	UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENT AND THE USER
Identifying user pain points or insights, marrying them with business goals via a series of workshops, interviews, User research and analysis enables me, to begin to define what the goal of the project is and define hypotheses behind it.
2.	UNDERSTANDING WHAT’S OUT THERE NOW, CURRENT TOOLS APPS AND COMPETITORS
Depending on whether a project is looking to enhance a current site, app or product or to deliver a completely new one, doing comprehensive research into the competitor market as well as retrieving any data the client has on their own customer activity is critical to UX.
UNDERSTANDING THE USER
The U in UX is there for a reason and identifying, learning about and trying to empathise with users is a skill us UXers must be able to display. I review the analytics and information we have about users and help create hypotheses that can be tested against any solution, prototype or research presented.


STANDARD UX ACTIVITIES

1.	Personas
a.	Talk with current customers or users
b.	Ensure I have the right age range, gender etc
c.	I make sure I can identify thier wants and needs
d.	I always introduce the wider team to the personas - full-size cardboard cut outs ensures the whole team doesn’t forget them

2.	User scenarios and journeys
a.	Can be detailed or high-level
b.	Reflects journey, not designs
c.	Should be reviewed and used by Agile testers and developers to aid their work
d.	Useful as tool in Agile estimation and planning
e.	Great for use in defining data flows as well

3.	Information Architecture
a.	Initially, I focus structure - what am I trying to present?
b.	Start with a sitemap, if relevant, rarely isn’t.
c.	Logical categorisation and position of content helped by card sort
d.	Consider navigation
e.	Validate with content owners and providers

4.	Sketching through to wireframes
a.	I ensure I understand what I’m trying to demonstrate.
b.	I sketch on whiteboard with team participating
c.	Develop initial concept sketches and user flows to help get consensus on what the team are trying to achieve
d.	Validate and test with users and stakeholders

5.	Prototyping
a.	I use Figma for simpler prototypes and Axure RP for fully functional prototypes
b.	Develop more detailed interactive prototypes possibly applying brand and UI designs using software such as Adobe Photoshop, Axure or Figma
c.	A prototype allows fully functional components to be tested with stakeholders and users.
d.	Great for Agile testing

6.	User testing / Usability testing
a.	I write test scripts and define, with Agile (TDD and BDT) testers, success criteria
b.	I have managed third-party and dedicated in-house user testing teams
c.	Always prefer to test every possible iteration of prototype or live software as it is iteratively developed
d.	Run surveys with users to evaluate how deliverables meet, or not, the hypotheses set out.
